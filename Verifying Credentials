# Twitter-API

Introduction to Twitter's API

Verifying Credentials

Every request sent to Twitter's API must be authorized. This exercise will have you register a new application with Twitter, obtain a consumer key (identifies your app) and an access token (identifies a user of your app), and check to make sure that you are sending the values correctly.

Visit https://dev.twitter.com/apps and register a new application.

On the application settings page, click "Create my access token" to generate an access token and secret.

Copy the values for consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret into the example.
